  how to register an actor dispatcher and the key properties of an actor.

Actor dispatcher
================

In ActivityPub, [actors] are entities that can perform [activities].  You can
register an actor dispatcher so that Fedify can dispatch an appropriate actor
by its bare handle (i.e., handle without @ prefix and domain suffix).
Since the actor dispatcher is the most significant part of the Fedify,
it is the first thing you need to do to make Fedify work.

An actor dispatcher is a callback function that takes a `Context` object and
a bare handle, and returns an actor object.  The actor object can be one of
the following:

 -  `Application`
 -  `Group`
 -  `Organization`
 -  `Person`
 -  `Service`

The below example shows how to register an actor dispatcher:

~~~~ typescript{7-15} twoslash
// @noErrors: 2451 2345
import type { Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
interface User { username: string }
const user = null as User | null;
// ---cut-before---
import { createFederation, Person } from "@fedify/fedify";

const federation = createFederation({
  // Omitted for brevity; see the related section for details.
});

federation.setActorDispatcher("/actors/{actorId}", async (ctx, actorId) => {
  // Work with the database to find the actor by the actorId.
  if (user == null) return null;  // Return null if the actor is not found.
  return new Person({
    id: ctx.getActorUri(actorId),
    preferredUsername: user.username,
    // Many more properties; see the next section for details.
  });
});
~~~~

In the above example, the `~Federation.setActorDispatcher()` method registers
an actor dispatcher for the `/actors/{actorId}` path.  This pattern syntax
follows the [URI Template] specification.

Key properties of an `Actor`
----------------------------

Despite ActivityPub declares every property of an actor as optional,
in practice, you need to set some of them to make the actor work properly
with the existing ActivityPub implementations.  The following shows
the key properties of an `Actor` object:

### `id`

The `~Object.id` property is the URI of the actor.  It is a required property
in ActivityPub.  You can use the `Context.getActorUri()` method to generate
the dereferenceable URI of the actor by its bare handle.

### `preferredUsername`

The `preferredUsername` property is the bare handle of the actor.  For the most
cases, this is set to `username` property to the `User` database record.

### `name`

The `~Object.name` property is the full name of the actor.

### `summary`

The `~Object.summary` property is usually a short biography of the actor.

### `url`

The `~Object.url` property usually refers to the actor's profile page.

### `published`

The `~Object.published` property is the date and time when the actor was
created.  Note that Fedify represents the date and time in
the [`Temporal.Instant`] value.

[`Temporal.Instant`]: https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/instant.html

### `inbox`

The `inbox` property is the URI of the actor's inbox.  You can use
the `Context.getInboxUri()` method to generate the URI of the actor's
inbox.

See the [*Inbox listeners*](./inbox.md) section for details.

### `outbox`

The `outbox` property is the URI of the actor's outbox.  You can use
the `Context.getOutboxUri()` method to generate the URI of the actor's
outbox.

### `followers`

The `followers` property is the URI of the actor's followers collection.
You can use the `Context.getFollowersUri()` method to generate the URI of
the actor's followers collection.

### `following`

The `following` property is the URI of the actor's following collection.
You can use the `Context.getFollowingUri()` method to generate the URI of
the actor's following collection.

### `endpoints`

The `endpoints` property is an `Endpoints` instance, an object that contains
the URIs of the actor's endpoints.  The most important endpoint is the `sharedInbox`.  You can use the `Context.getInboxUri()` method with no arguments
to generate the URI of the actor's shared inbox:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import { Endpoints, Context } from "@fedify/fedify";
const ctx = null as unknown as Context<void>;
// ---cut-before---
new Endpoints({ sharedInbox: ctx.getInboxUri() })
~~~~

### `publicKey`

The `publicKey` property contains the public key of the actor.  It is
a `CryptographicKey` instance.  This property is usually used for verifying
[HTTP Signatures](./send.md#http-signatures).

See the [next section](#public-keys-of-an-actor) for details.

> [!TIP]
> In theory, an actor has multiple `publicKeys`, but in practice, the most
> implementations have trouble with multiple keys.  Therefore, it is recommended
> to set only one key in the `publicKey` property.  Usually, it contains
> the first RSA-PKCS#1-v1.5 public key of the actor.
>
> If you need to set multiple keys, you can use the `assertionMethods` property
> instead.

### `assertionMethods`

*This API is available since Fedify 0.10.0.*

The `assertionMethods` property contains the public keys of the actor.  It is
an array of `Multikey` instances.  This property is usually used for verifying
[Object Integrity Proofs](./send.md#object-integrity-proofs).

> [!TIP]
> Usually, the `assertionMethods` property contains the Ed25519 public keys of
> the actor.  Although it is okay to include RSA-PKCS#1-v1.5 public keys too,
> those RSA-PKCS#1-v1.5 keys are not used for verifying Object Integrity Proofs.


Public keys of an `Actor`
-------------------------

In order to sign and verify the activities, you need to set the `publicKey` and
`assertionMethods` property of the actor.  The `publicKey` property contains
a `CryptographicKey` instance, and the `assertionMethods` property contains
an array of `Multikey` instances.  Usually you don't have to create them
manually.  Instead, you can register a key pairs dispatcher through
the `~ActorCallbackSetters.setKeyPairsDispatcher()` method so that Fedify can
dispatch appropriate key pairs by the actor's bare handle:

~~~~ typescript{4-6,10-14,17-26} twoslash
import { type Federation, Person } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
interface User { username: string }
const user = null as User | null;
const publicKey1 = null as unknown as CryptoKey;
const privateKey1 = null as unknown as CryptoKey;
const publicKey2 = null as unknown as CryptoKey;
const privateKey2 = null as unknown as CryptoKey;
// ---cut-before---
federation.setActorDispatcher("/actors/{actorId}", async (ctx, actorId) => {
  // Work with the database to find the actor by the actorId.
  if (user == null) return null;  // Return null if the actor is not found.
  // Context.getActorKeyPairs() method dispatches the key pairs of an actor
  // by the handle, and returns an array of key pairs in various formats:
  const keys = await ctx.getActorKeyPairs(handle);
  return new Person({
    id: ctx.getActorUri(actorId),
    preferredUsername: user.username,
    // For the publicKey property, we only use first CryptographicKey:
    publicKey: keys[0].cryptographicKey,
    // For the assertionMethods property, we use all Multikey instances:
    assertionMethods: keys.map((key) => key.multikey),
    // Many more properties; see the previous section for details.
  });
})
  .setKeyPairsDispatcher(async (ctx, actorId) => {
    // Work with the database to find the key pair by the actorId.
    if (user == null) return [];  // Return null if the key pair is not found.
    // Return the loaded key pair.  See the below example for details.
    return [
      { publicKey: publicKey1, privateKey: privateKey1 },
      { publicKey: publicKey2, privateKey: privateKey2 },
      // ...
    ];
  });
~~~~

In the above example, the `~ActorCallbackSetters.setKeyPairsDispatcher()` method
registers a key pairs dispatcher.  The key pairs dispatcher is a callback
function that takes context data and a bare handle, and returns an array of
[`CryptoKeyPair`] object which is defined in the Web Cryptography API.

Usually, you need to generate key pairs for each actor when the actor is
created (i.e., when a new user is signed up), and securely store actor's key
pairs in the database.  The key pairs dispatcher should load the key pairs from
the database and return them.

How to generate key pairs and store them in the database is out of the scope of
this document, but here's a simple example of how to generate key pairs and
store them in a [Deno KV] database in form of JWK:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
const actorId: string = "";
// ---cut-before---
import { generateCryptoKeyPair, exportJwk } from "@fedify/fedify";

const kv = await Deno.openKv();
const rsaPair = await generateCryptoKeyPair("RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5");
const ed25519Pair = await generateCryptoKeyPair("Ed25519");
await kv.set(["keypair", "rsa", actorId], {
  privateKey: await exportJwk(rsaPair.privateKey),
  publicKey: await exportJwk(rsaPair.publicKey),
});
await kv.set(["keypair", "ed25519", actorId], {
  privateKey: await exportJwk(ed25519Pair.privateKey),
  publicKey: await exportJwk(ed25519Pair.publicKey),
});
~~~~

> [!TIP]

Here's an example of how to load key pairs from the database too:

~~~~ typescript{12-34} twoslash
// @noErrors: 2345
import { type Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
// ---cut-before---
import { importJwk } from "@fedify/fedify";

interface KeyPairEntry {
  privateKey: JsonWebKey;
  publicKey: JsonWebKey;
}

federation
  .setActorDispatcher("/actors/{actorId}", async (ctx, actorId) => {
    // Omitted for brevity; see the previous example for details.
  })
  .setKeyPairsDispatcher(async (ctx, actorId) => {
    const kv = await Deno.openKv();
    const result: CryptoKeyPair[] = [];
    const rsaPair = await kv.get<KeyPairEntry>(
      ["keypair", "rsa", actorId],
    );
    if (rsaPair?.value != null) {
      result.push({
        privateKey: await importJwk(rsaPair.value.privateKey, "private"),
        publicKey: await importJwk(rsaPair.value.publicKey, "public"),
      });
    }
    const ed25519Pair = await kv.get<KeyPairEntry>(
      ["keypair", "ed25519", actorId],
    );
    if (ed25519Pair?.value != null) {
      result.push({
        privateKey: await importJwk(ed25519Pair.value.privateKey, "private"),
        publicKey: await importJwk(ed25519Pair.value.publicKey, "public"),
      });
    }
    return result;
  });

Constructing actor URIs
-----------------------

To construct an actor URI, you can use the `Context.getActorUri()` method.
This method takes a bare handle and returns a dereferenceable URI of the actor.

The below example shows how to construct an actor URI:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
import type { Context } from "@fedify/fedify";
const ctx = null as unknown as Context<void>;
// ---cut-before---
ctx.getActorUri("2bd304f9-36b3-44f0-bf0b-29124aafcbb4") // john_doe
~~~~

In the above example, the `Context.getActorUri()` method generates the
dereferenceable URI of the actor with the bare handle `"2bd304f9-36b3-44f0-bf0b-29124aafcbb4"`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The `Context.getActorUri()` method does not guarantee that the actor
> URI is always dereferenceable for every argument.  Make sure that
> the argument is a valid bare handle before calling the method.


Decoupling actor URIs from WebFinger usernames
----------------------------------------------

*This API is available since Fedify 0.15.0.*

> [!TIP]
> The WebFinger username means the username part of the `acct:` URI or
> the fediverse handle.  For example, the WebFinger username of the
> `acct:fedify@hollo.social` URI or the `@fedify@hollo.social` handle
> is `fedify`.

By default, Fedify uses the bare handle as the WebFinger username.  However,
you can decouple the WebFinger username from the bare handle by registering
an actor handle mapper through the `~ActorCallbackSetters.mapHandle()` method:

~~~~ typescript twoslash
// @noErrors: 2391 2345
import { type Federation } from "@fedify/fedify";
const federation = null as unknown as Federation<void>;
interface User { uuid: string; username: string }
/**
 * It's a hypothetical function that finds a user by the UUID.
 * @param uuid The UUID of the user.
 * @returns The user object.
 */
function findUserByUuid(uuid: string): User;
/**
 * It's a hypothetical function that finds a user by the username.
 * @param username The username of the user.
 * @returns The user object.
 */
function findUserByUsername(username: string): User;
// ---cut-before---
federation
  .setActorDispatcher("/actors/{actorId}", async (ctx, actorId) => {
    // Since we map a WebFinger handle to the corresponding user's UUID below,
    // the `actorId` parameter is the user's UUID, not the WebFinger username:
    const user = await findUserByUuid(actorId);
    // Omitted for brevity; see the previous example for details.
  })
  .mapHandle(async (ctx, username) => {
    // Work with the database to find the WebFinger username by the handle.
    const user = await findUserByUsername(username);
    if (user == null) return null;  // Return null if the actor is not found.
    return user.uuid;
  });
~~~~

Decoupling the WebFinger username from the bare handle is useful when you want
to let users change their WebFinger username without breaking the existing
network, because changing the WebFinger username does not affect the actor URI.

> [!NOTE]
> We highly recommend you to set the actor's `preferredUsername` property to
> the corresponding WebFinger username so that peers can find the actor's
> fediverse handle by fetching the actor object.


WebFinger links
---------------

Some properties of an `Actor` returned by the actor dispatcher affect
responses to WebFinger requests.

### `preferredUsername`

*This API is available since Fedify 0.15.0.*

The `preferredUsername` property is the bare handle of the actor.  It is
used as the WebFinger username, used in the `acct:` URI of the `aliases`
property of the WebFinger response.

### `url`

The `url` property usually refers to the actor's profile page.  It is
used as the `links` property of the WebFinger response, with the `rel`
property set to <http://webfinger.net/rel/profile-page>.

### `icon`

*This API is available since Fedify 1.0.0.*

The `icon` property is an `Image` object that represents the actor's
icon (i.e., avatar).  It is used as the `links` property of the WebFinger
response, with the `rel` property set to <http://webfinger.net/rel/avatar>.
